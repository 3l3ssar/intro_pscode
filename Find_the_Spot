# start the app
# set up a warehouse map with 12 aisles (6 on each side)
# place entrance/exit on the east wall in the north corner
# let the customer start somewhere on the map
# while the customer hasn't found the spot:
# ask which direction they want to move (north, south, east, west)
# if they want to move north:
# if they're already on the northern edge:
# say "you can't go north anymore, please turn around"
# otherwise:
# move north by one space
# if they want to move south:
# if they're already on the southern edge:
# say "you can't go south anymore, please turn around"
# otherwise:
# move south by one space
# if they want to move east:
# if they're already on the eastern edge:
# say "you can't go east anymore, please turn around"
# otherwise:
# move east by one space
# if they want to move west:
# if they're already on the western edge:
# say "you can't go west anymore, please turn around"
# otherwise:
# move west by one space
# if they reach the correct location:
# say "x marks the spot!"
# ask if they want to search for a new location or quit
# if they want to quit:
# say "thank you for using Find the Spot! Goodbye!" 
# end the app
# otherwise:
# reset the map and start again
